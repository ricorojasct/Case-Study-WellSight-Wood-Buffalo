WellSight Wood Buffalo: Oil & Gas Well Health Analysis
Project Overview
WellSight Wood Buffalo is a comprehensive Power BI analytics solution that evaluates the operational integrity, production efficiency, and well health of oil and gas operations in Alberta's Wood Buffalo region. By integrating multiple datasets from the Petrinex Alberta Public Data Portal, this project provides data-driven insights for investment decisions, operational optimization, and sustainability planning.
Analysis Period: January - August 2025
Geographic Focus: Wood Buffalo Region, Alberta
Total Wells Analyzed: 180 wells across 22 active operators

Project Objectives
This analysis addresses five critical business questions:

Operator Excellence: Which operators maintain the healthiest and most productive well portfolios in Wood Buffalo?
Well Health Assessment: What is the overall health profile and lifecycle distribution of wells in the region?
Performance Correlation: How does production performance relate to well lifecycle and operational integrity?
Operational Patterns: How do production and injection patterns reflect operational integrity over time?
Investment Targeting: Are there geographic or operational trends that could guide future capital allocation?
